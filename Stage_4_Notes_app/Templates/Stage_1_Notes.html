			<h3>Languages of a Webpage</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
				Web pages can can be made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript, which are each a language.  A good way to think of these is to think of a house:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML is like the walls of a house.  it is essentially the "structure" or building material.</li>
					<li>CSS is like the decor - what the house looks like.  Think paint on the walls, art, colors used, size and proportion of the furniture.</li>
					<li>Javascript is like the interactive elements of the house. Think - light switches, doors..</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>HTML's "tree-like" Structure</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				This is exactly what it sounds like.  You can essentially draw out a web page as a tree; meaning a "div" can branch into a "header" and a "paragraph".  
				Each of those branches can branch even further depending on what is nested inside of them.  Elements define what the branches are and these are 
				nested in other elements.

			<h3>Speaking of Structure</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				If you look at the HTML code of a web page the structure looks like a wave or zigzags.  This kind of structure helps when reading the code 
				to see where sections start and end.  While some editors seem to gently create this structure while you are writing the code, it is not a given.

			<h3>CSS - Adding Style to the Structure</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				CSS allows you to give your webpage style.  This is a separate file that the browser will read and link to the HTML file.
				Throughout the code you have many different "blocks", you can assign these blocks classes and use the CSS file to give that class a unique style.  
				This is helpful because this allows you to set a style easily for different blocks, without having to repeat the style setup each time.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is definately a <em><b>LOT</b></em> more to learn about CSS.  It is clear from the last segment that CSS is a powerful tool 
				and will take time to learn (most likely from playing and failing) <img src="http://i.imgur.com/uZfdhRl.gif" width="30" height="30"

			<div>
				Things to note about CSS
				<ul>
					<li>CSS = Cascading Stylesheets</li>
					<li>You can also define your styles in the html file itself by adding &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; in the head section.</li>
					<li>If the section in CSS starts with a "." then it is defining a Class.</li>
					<li>If the selector is a tag without the brackets (i.e. "em" instead of &lt;em&gt;), then it is defining the style of that tag.</li>
					<li>Things that can be inherited: color, font, letter spacing, line height, list style, text alignment, text indentation, text transform, 
					visibility, white space and word spacing (probably others?)</li>
					<li>Things that are not inherited: background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min/max height & width, 
					outline, overflow, padding, position, text decoration, vertical alignment and z index (probably others?)</li>
					<li>"The Box Model" - Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
				
			<p>Older browsers don't always like CSS, so add this to the beginning of the CSS file:<br>
			</p>
			
			<div class="codeex">
				* { <br>
   					-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
   					-moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
   					-ms-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
    				box-sizing: border-box;<br>
				}<br>
